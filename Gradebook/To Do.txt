-Styling Issues
	- "Thanks for signing in! Add a course to get started!
	- "Welcome Back! Select a course to get started!"
	- Fix buttons placements in each of the settings tabs.
	- Finish all of the styling in each of the settings tabs.
	- In Settings>Assessment Settings when you click edit and click on the input of the assessmentType Name, the underline color is not correct.

-Functionality Issues
- Finish the login/lougout/register functionality and styling.
- Limit the number of characters you can have in your course name (brings up issues in sidenav if too long).
- In Settings>General Settings, change Course Year to a dropdown menu.
- In each of the Settings' Tabs, check the input type to ensure only numbers can be inputted for the weights.

Add Course Modal: 
- if user inputs more then 20 characters in the course Name, and tries to submit, leave modal open with an error message
- For some reason, when user inputs > 20 characters the input line doesn't get red until user has clicked off. On Materialize the input box gets red immediately.
